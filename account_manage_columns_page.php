/**
 * This page allows a user to manage the column api data stored in their profile.
 *
 * Users are presented with a list of available columns (fields). They mean then choose which types
 * of field to include on the following types of pages:
 * i) "View Issues Columns" - These are the fields displayed when viewing the list of bugs
 * ii) "Print Issues Columns" - These are the fields that are included when printing out bug
 * details.
 * iii) "Export Issues Columns" - These are the list of fields included when exporting an issue from
 * the bug tracker.
 * Note: These are now shared between different types of exports - for example, the core MantisBT
 * distribution can export to Excel and Word Documents.
 *
 * The settings defined here can be allocated to the current project, or All Projects. In addition,
 * it is possible to copy the column configuration between different projects.
