INSTALLATION

The following details the basic steps for installation on any system.  The
instructions may seem unix-centric but should work fine on Windows systems.

Barring complications, it should take you about 10-20 minutes to install,
configure, and be using Mantis.

These instructions are also available at:
http://manual.mantisbt.org/manual.installation.php

# --- Requirements ----------

* MySQL 3.23.2 and higher
* PHP 4.0.6 and higher
* a webserver

# --- Summary ---------------

1. Tranfer files
2. Uncompress files
3. Generate database tables
4. Edit configuration file
5. PHP File extensions
6. Login

******************************************************************************

This installation process has changed with release 1.0.0.

1. First, transfer the file to your webserver using whatever method you like
best (ftp, scp, etc).  You will need to telnet/ssh into the server machine for
the next steps.

2. Next, untar/gunzip it to the directory that you want.
The usual command is (1 step):

	tar zxvf <filename.tar.gz>

OR  (2 steps):

	gunzip <filename.tar.gz>
	tar xvf <filename.tar>

Winzip, Stuffit, and other programs should also be able to handle
decompression of the archive.

At this point you may want to rename the directory to something simpler like
'mantis'.  You will use the mv command to rename a directory (Windows users
substitute the "ren" command or use explorer).

mv <directoryname> mantis

If you are upgrading see the UPGRADING document.

3. Next we will create the necessary database tables and a basic configuration
file.

From your web server, access http://yoursite/mantis/admin/install.php

This page will walk through the following steps:
a) check basic parameters for the web server
b) prompt for the database type and location, and a database user/password 
pair. For installiion, an administrative user/password pair can also be 
provided. The operating user requires ALTER, SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE
privileges. For installation, INDEX, CREATE, DELETE, and DROP privileges are
also required.
c) create the database and tables.

* WARNING: A DEFAULT ADMINISTRATOR level account is created.  The account name
and password are administrator / root.  Use this when you first login to
Mantis. Immediately go to Manage and create at least one administrator level
account.  Immediately after that DISABLE or DELETE the administrator account.  
You can recreate it but you should delete the account to prevent the 
cookie_string from being used to trick the package.  It would be even better 
to rename the account or delete it permanently.  REMEMBER: After setting up 
the package, REMOVE the default administrator account.

d) write a basic "config_inc.php file to define the database.
e) perform some post installation checks on the system.

4. The next part involves configuring the installation to work with your
specific setup.

Open the file in an editor and add anyother values that are required. There are 
many more that you can use to customize your Mantis installation.  See the 
doc/CUSTOMIZATION file for in depth explanations.

The file will overwrite the default values with those necessary for setup.

You can load up admin/check.php to see if you set things up correctly.

*** NOTE: check.php sometimes reports the value of register_globals
incorrectly.  Create a page with this line in it: <? phpinfo() ?>, save it
with a .php extension and load it up in your web browser.  It will, among a
multitude of other things, have the correct value of register_globals that you
are using.

5. Mantis now uses only .php files.

If your webserver is configured for other extensions (.PHP3, .PHTML) then you
will have to have the administrator add support for .PHP files.  This should
be a trivial modification.

Documentation can be found at: http://www.php.net/manual/en/installation.php

6.  Login to your bugtracker and go to the manage section.  Click on the
projects link.  You will need to ADD a new project.  Then EDIT the new project
and remember to ADD at least one category.  Otherwise you won't be able to add
any bug reports.

That should be it.  You're off and running.  For some help on custom editing
of the site please read the CUSTOMIZATION file.
