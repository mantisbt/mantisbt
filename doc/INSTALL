REQUIREMENTS

 * MySQL 4.1.1+, PostgreSQL 8+, or other supported database
 * PHP 5.1.0+
 * a webserver (e.g. Apache or IIS)

INSTALLATION

 * Extract the tarball into a location readable by your web server

 * Point your browser to http://path/to/mantisbt/admin/install.php to begin the
   database installation process

 * Select the database type and enter the credentials to access the database

 * Installation is complete -- you may need to copy the default configuration
   to mantisbt/config_inc.php if your web server does not have write access

 * Point your browser to http://path/to/mantisbt/admin/check.php to ensure that
   your webserver is compatible with MantisBT and configured correctly

 * Remove the admin/ directory from within the MantisBT installation path. The
   scripts within this directory should not be accessible on a live MantisBT
   site or on any installation that is accessible via the Internet.

UPGRADING

 * Backup your existing installation and database -- really!

 * Extract the tarball into a clean directory; do NOT extract into an existing
   installation, as some files have been moved or deleted between releases

 * Copy your configuration from the old installation to the new directory,
   including config_inc.php, custom_strings_inc.php, and
   custom_constants_inc.php if they exist

 * Point your browser to http://path/to/_NEW_mantisbt/admin/install.php to
   upgrade the database schema

 * Click install/upgrade

 * Point your browser to http://path/to/_NEW_mantisbt/admin/check.php to ensure that
   your webserver is compatible with MantisBT and configured correctly

 * Remove the admin/ directory from within the MantisBT installation path. The
   scripts within this directory should not be accessible on a live MantisBT
   site or on any installation that is accessible via the Internet.

 * To restore your original MantisBT URL operation it is best at this point
   to delete the old MantisBT directory and rename the directory you
   extracted the tarball to to the original directory name.

 * Upgrading is complete
