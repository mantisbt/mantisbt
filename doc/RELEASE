   Refer to issue #15573 for detailed information.

1.2.14 Security Release (2013-01-29)
-------------------------------------------------

MantisBT 1.2.14 is a security update for the stable 1.2.x branch. All
installations that are currently running any 1.2.x version are strongly advised
to upgrade to this release.

Four cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability issues were discovered and
resolved:

 - A malicious person could trick a target user's browser into executing
   arbitrary JavaScript code (CVE-2013-0197). This vulnerability is critical,
   due to the affected page (search.php) being usable anonymously on public-
   facing installations (i.e. without the need for a user login).
   Affects MantisBT 1.2.12 only (earlier versions are not impacted)
   Refer to issue #15373 for detailed information.

 - A user holding manager/administrator permissions could create a category or
   project name containing JavaScript code; from that point on, visitors to
   (a) the Summary page (summary.php) as well as (b) the Configuration Report
   page (adm_config_report.php), are exposed to having the JavaScript execute
   within their browser environment. The severity of this issue is mitigated by
   the need to have a privileged account to modify category and project names.
   Issue (a) affects MantisBT version 1.2.12 and above, while (b) is on 1.2.13
   only; earlier releases are not impacted.
   Refer to issues #15384 (a) and #15415 (b) for detailed information.

 - An administrator could enter a configuration option containing javascript
   code, which would then be executed when displaying the Configuration Report
   page (adm_config_report.php). The severity of this issue is mitigated by the
   need to have a privileged account. Affects all MantisBT 1.2.x versions.
   Refer to issue #15416 for detailed information.

A workflow-related security issue was also fixed:

 - A user with "Reporter" permissions can modify the workflow status of any
   issue to "New" even if they do not have the necessary privileges to make
   this change.
   Refer to issue #15258 for detailed information.

In addition to the corrections for the above-mentioned security issues, this
release also includes several bug fixes and enhancements:

 - improved Manage Configuration page (better performance, ability to filter
   and edit config options)
 - support for the built-in SOAP extension in addition to nusoap
 - updated translations in many languages

A full changelog for the 1.2.x series can be found on the official site. [1]


1.2.13 Security Release (2013-01-22)
-------------------------------------------------

This version had to be withdrawn shortly after release, as it introduced a bug
(#15411) causing the View Issues page to consume significantly more memory for
instances with large numbers of users (order 10k+), leading to system crashes,
as well as an XSS issue (#15415) in the Configuration Report page.

We recommend not to use 1.2.13, and deploy version 1.2.14 instead.


1.2.12 Maintenance Release (2012-11-10)
-------------------------------------------------

fields, installation, attachments, SOAP API, XML import/export plugin,
e-mail (including update of the PHPMailer library to version 5.2.1) and others.

In addition, it also brings several enhancements:
 - filter page now allows 'OR' logic and to query by notes' authors
 - improved e-mail logging (see #14630)
 - new 'EVENT_UPDATE_BUG_STATUS_FORM' plugin event

-------------------------------------------------

installations that are currently running any 1.2.x version are advised to
upgrade to this release.

Paulino Calderon from Websec, High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab and Paul
Richards discovered 3 vulnerabilities:
 - 1x local file inclusion (LFI)/directory traversal
 - 2x cross site scriptin (XSS)

These vulnerabilities could have very severe consequences for users of
MantisBT, particularly as a result of the local file inclusion vulnerability.
If an attacker can upload their own PHP script to the server as an attachment,
they may be able to execute this script using the LFI vulnerability.

Refer to issues #13191 and #13281 for detailed information.
