			<title>Prebuilt SOAP stubs using Axis</title>

				For ease of integration of the Java clients, SOAP stubs are
				maintained and deployed in the
				<ulink url="https://search.maven.org/">Maven central repository</ulink>.
				For example:

	<section id="soapapi.compatibility">
		<title>Compatibility between releases</title>

		<para>
			The SOAP API signature will change between minor releases,
			typically to add new functionality or to extend existing features.
		</para>

		<para>
			Some of these changes might require a refresh of the client
			libraries generated, for instance Apache Axis 1 SOAP stubs must
			be regenerated if a complex type receives a new property. Such
			changes will be announced before the release of the new MantisBT
			version on the
			<ulink url="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mantisbt/lists/mantisbt-soap-dev">
				mantisbt-soap-dev mailing list</ulink>.
			Typically there will be two weeks time to integrate the new SOAP stubs.
