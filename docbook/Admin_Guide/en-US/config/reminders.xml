	<title>Reminders</title>

	<para>Sending reminders is a feature where a user can notify /
		remind other users about a bug. In the past, only selected users
		like the managers, or developers would get notified about bugs.
		However, these people can not invite other people (through MantisBT)
		to look at or monitor these bugs.
	</para>
	<para>This feature is useful if the Manager needs to get feedback
		from testers / requirements team about a certain bug. It avoid
		needing this person to do this manual outside MantisBT. It also
		records the history of such reminders.
	</para>
