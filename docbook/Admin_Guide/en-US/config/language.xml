			<term>$g_default_language</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>This is the language used by default in MantisBT.  This may be set
		to 'auto' where MantisBT will try to determine the language from the browser.

			<term>$g_language_choices_arr</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>This is to be set to an array of languages that are
					available for users to choose from. The default value includes all
					languages supported by MantisBT. The administrator can limit the
					languages available for users to choose from by overriding this
					value. For example, to support English, French and German include
					the following code:
<programlisting>
$g_language_choices_arr = array( 'english', 'french', 'german' );
</programlisting>
					Of course, administrators can also add their own languages
					by translating the strings and creating their own language files.
					You are encouraged to share any translation work that you do with
					the MantisBT team. This will ensure that the newly created language
					file is maintained with future MantisBT releases.All language files
					reside in the lang/ folder. They are all named according to the
					following pattern: strings_&lt;language&gt;.txt.

				<para>This is the language used if MantisBT cannot determine the

					language from the browser.
