        <title>Creating User Accounts</title>

        <para>In MantisBT, there is no limit on the number of user
	accounts that can be created.  Typically, installations with thousands
	of users tend to have a limited number of users that have access level
	above REPORTER.</para>

	<para>By default users with ADMINISTRATOR access level have access to create
	new user accounts.  The steps to do that are:

            <itemizedlist>
	        <listitem>
	            <para>Click "Manage" on Main Menu.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Click "Manage Users" (if not selected by default).</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Click "Create New Account" button just below the alphabet
		key.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Enter user name, email address, global access level (more details about
		access levels later).  Other fields are optional.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Click "Create Users".</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
	</para>

        <para>Creating a user triggers the following actions:
	<itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	        <para>Creating a user in the database.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	        <para>If email notifications ($g_enable_email_notification) is
		set to ON, then the user will receive an email allowing them to
		activate their account and set their password.  Otherwise, the
		account will be created with a blank password.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	        <para>If email notifications ($g_enable_email_notification) is
		set to ON, users with access level about
		$g_notify_new_user_created_threshold_min will get a
		notification that a user account has been created.  Information
		about the user like user name and email address are provided.
		The IP of the user that created the account is also
		included.</para>
	    </listitem>
	</itemizedlist></para>

	<para>When the 'Protected' flag is set on a user account, it indicates
	that the account is a shared account (e.g. demo account) and hence users
	logged using such account will not be allowed to change account
	preferences and profile information.</para>

	<para>The anonymous user account specified with the $g_anonymous_account
	option will always be treated as a protected user account. When you are
	creating the anonymous user account, the 'Protected' flag is essentially
	ignored because the anonymous user is always treated as a protected
	user.</para>

    </section>

    <section id="admin.user.enable">
        <title>Enabling/Disabling User Accounts</title>

	<para>The recommended way of retiring user accounts is to disable them.
	Scenarios where this is useful is when a person leaves the team and it
	is necessary to retire their account.</para>

	<para>Once an account is disabled the following will be enforced:
	<itemizedlist>
	   <listitem>
	       <para>All currently active sessions for the account will be
	       invalidated (i.e. automatically logged out).</para>
	   </listitem>
	   <listitem>
	       <para>It will no longer be possible login using this account.</para>
	   </listitem>
	   <listitem>
	       <para>No further email notifications will be sent to the account
	       once it is disabled.</para>
	   </listitem>
	   <listitem>
	       <para>The user account will not show anymore in lists like
	       "assign to", "send reminder to", etc.</para>
	   </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>

	<para>The disabling process is totally reversible.  Hence, the account
	can be re-enabled and all the account history will remain intact.  For
	example, the user will still have issues reported by them, assigned to
	them, monitored by them, etc.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="admin.user.delete">
        <title>Deleting User Accounts</title>

	<para>Another way to retire user accounts is by deleting them.  This
	approach is only recommended for accounts that have not been active
	(i.e. haven't reported issues).  Once the account is deleted, any
	issues or actions associated with such account, will be associated with
	user123 (where 123 is the code of the account that was deleted).  Note
	that associated issues or actions are not deleted.</para>

	<para>As far as the underlying database, after the deletion of a user,
	records with the user id as a foreign key will have a value that no
	longer exists in the users table.  Hence, any tools that operate
	directly on the database must take this into consideration.</para>

	<para>By default administrators are the only users who can delete user
	accounts.  They can delete accounts by clicking Manage, Manage Users,
	locating the user to be deleted and opening it details page, then
	clicking on the "Delete User" button which deletes the user.</para>

	<para>Note that "Deleting Users" is not a reversible process.  Hence, if
	it is required to re-add the user account, it is not possible to
	recreate the user account so that it gets the same ID and hence retains
	its history.  However, manually creating a record in the users table
	with the same id, can possibly do that.  However, this approach is not
	recommended or supported.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="admin.user.signup">
        <title>User Signup</title>

	<para>For open source and freeware projects, it is very common to setup
	MantisBT so that users can signup for an account and get a REPORTER
	access by default (configurable by the
	$g_default_new_account_access_level configuration option).  The signup
	process can be enabled / disabled using the $g_allow_signup
	configuration option, which is enabled by default.</para>

        <para>If email notifications ($g_enable_email_notification) is
        set to ON, users with access level about
	$g_notify_new_user_created_threshold_min will get a
	notification that a user account has been created.  Information
	about the user like user name, email address, IP address are included in
	the email notification.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="admin.user.passwordreset">
        <title>Forgot Password and Reset Password</title>

	<para>It is pretty common for users to forget their password.  MantisBT
	provides two ways to handle such scenario: "Forgot Password" and "Reset
	Password".</para>

	<para>"Forgot Password" is a self service scenario where users go to the
	login page, figure out they don't remember their password, and then click
	the "Lost your password?" link.  Users are then asked for their user
	name and email address.  If correct, then they are sent an email with a
	link which allows them to login to MantisBT and change their password.</para>

	<para>"Reset Password" scenario is where a user reports to the
	administrator that they are not able to login into MantisBT anymore.
	This can be due to forgetting their password and possibly user name or
	email address that they used when signing up.  The administrator then
	goes to Manage, Manage Users, locates the user account and opens its
	details.  Under the user account details, there is a "Reset Password"
	button which the administrator can click to reset the password and
	trigger an email to the user to allow them to get into MantisBT and set
	their password.  In the case where email notifications are disabled,
	resetting password will set the password to an empty string.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="admin.user.passwordchange">
        <title>Changing Password</title>

	<para>Users are able to change their own passwords (unless their account
	is "protected").  This can be done by clicking on "My Account", and then
	typing the new password in the "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields,
	then clicking "Update User".  Changing the password automatically
	invalidates all logged in sessions and hence the user will be required
	to re-login.  Invalidating existing sessions is very useful in the case
	where a user going onto a computer, logs into MantisBT and leaves the
	computer without logging out.  By changing the password from another
	computer, the session on the original computer automatically becomes
	invalidated.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="admin.user.pruning">
        <title>Pruning User Accounts</title>

	<para>The pruning function allows deleting of user accounts for accounts
	that have been created more than a week ago, and they never logged in.
	This is particulary useful for users who signed up with an invalid email
	or with a typo in their email address address.</para>

	<para>The account pruning can be done by administrators by going to
	"Manage", "Manage Users", and clicking the "Prune Accounts" button
	inside the "Never Logged In" box.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="admin.user.access">
        <title>Authorization and Access Levels</title>

	<para>MantisBT uses access levels to define what a user can do.  Each
	user account has a global or default access level that is associated
	with it.  This access level is used as the access level for such users
	for all actions associated with public projects as well as actions that
	are not related to a specific project.  Users with global access level
	less than $g_private_project_threshold will not have access to private
	projects by default.</para>

	<para>The default access levels shipped with MantisBT out of the box are
	VIEWER, REPORTER, UPDATER, DEVELOPER, MANAGER and ADMINISTRATOR.  Each
	features has several configuration options associated with it and
	identifies the required access level to do certain actions.  For
	example, viewing an issue, reporting an issue, updating an issue, adding
	a note, etc.</para>

	<para>For example, in the case of reporting issues, the required access
	level is configurable using the $g_report_bug_threshold configuration
	option (which is defaulted to REPORTER).  So for a user to be able to
	report an issue against a public project, the user must have a
	project-specific or a global access level that is greater than or equal
	to REPORTER.  However, in the case of reporting an issue against a
	private project, the user must have project specific access level (that
	is explicitly granted against the project) that is higher than REPORTER
	or have a global access level that is higher than both
	$g_private_project_threshold and $g_report_bug_threshold.</para>

	<para>Note that project specific access levels override the global
	access levels.  For example, a user may have REPORTER as the global
	access level, but have a MANAGER access level to a specific project.  Or
	a user may have MANAGER as the global access level by VIEWER access to
	a specific project.  Access levels can be overriden for both public and
	private projects.  However, overriding access level is not allowed for
	users with global access ADMINISTRATOR.</para>

	<para>Each feature typically has multiple access control configuration
	options to defines what access level can do certain operations.  For
	example, adding a note may require REPORTER access level, updating a
	note my require DEVELOPER access level, unless the own was owned by the
	same user and in this case REPORTER access level.  Such threshold
	configuration options can be set to a single access level, which means
	users with such threshold and above are authorized to do such action.
	The other option is to specify an array of access level which indicates
	that users with the explicitly specific thresholds are allowed to do
	such actions.</para>

        <para>It is also worth mentioning that the access levels are defined by
	the $g_access_levels_enum_string configuration option, and it is
	possible to customize such list.  The default value for the available
	access levels is '10:viewer, 25:reporter, 40:updater, 55:developer,
	70:manager, 90:administrator'.  The instructions about how to customize
	the list of access levels will be covered in the customization section.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="admin.user.autocreate">
        <title>Auto Creation of Accounts on Login</title>

	<para>In some cases MantisBT is setup in a way, where it allows users
	that already exists in a directory or another application to be
	automatically authenticated and added to MantisBT.  For example, a
	company may setup their MantisBT installation in a way, where its staff
	members that are already registered in their LDAP directory, should be
	allowed to login into MantisBT with the same user name and password.
	Another example, is where MantisBT is integrated into some content
	management system, where it is desired to have a single registration and
	single sign-on experience.  In such scenarios, once a user logs in for
	the first time, a user account is automatically created for them,
	although the password verification is still done against LDAP or the
	main users repository.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="admin.user.prefs">
        <title>User Preferences</title>

	<para>Users can fine tune they way MantisBT interacts with them via
	modifying their user preferences.  User preferences can only be managed
	by users and are not available for the administrators to tweak.  The
	administrators can only tweak the default value for such preferences.
	However, once a user account is created, it is then the responsibility
	of the user to manage their own preferences.  The user preferences
	include the following:

	<itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	        <para>Default Project: A user can choose the default project
		that is selected when the user first logs in.  This can be a
		specific project or "All Projects".  For users that only work on
		one project, it would make sense to set such project as the
		default project (rather than "All Projects").  The active
		project is part of the filter applied on the issues listed in
		the "View Issues" page.  Also any newly reported issues will be
		associated with the active project.</para>
             </listitem>
	     <listitem>
	        <para>Refresh Delay: The refresh delay is used to specify the
		number of seconds between auto-refreshes of the View Issues
		page.</para>
	     </listitem>
	     <listitem>
	        <para>Redirect Delay: The redirect delay is the number of
		seconds to wait after displaying flash messages like "Issue created
		successfully", and before the user gets redirected to the
		next page.</para>
	     </listitem>
	     <listitem>
	        <para>Notes Sort Order: The preference relating to how notes
		should be ordered on an issue is viewed or in email
		notifications.  The ascending order is where notes are ordered
		so that ordered notes appear before newer notes, the descending
		order is the reverse.</para>
	     </listitem>
	     <listitem>
	        <para>Email on New: If unticked, then email notifications
		relating to creation of a new issue would be disabled.  Note
		that the preference is only used to disabled notifications that
		as per the administrator's configuration, this user would have
		qualified to receive them.</para>
	     </listitem>
	     <listitem>
	        <para>Email on Change of Handler: TODO - is this preference
		used?</para>
	     </listitem>
	     <listitem>
	        <para>Email on Feedback: TODO - is this preference used?</para>
	     </listitem>

	     </listitem>
	     <listitem>
	        <para>Email Notes Limit: This preference can be used to limit
		the number of issue notes to view or to be included in an email
		notifications.  Specifying N here means that the latest N
		notes will be included.  The value 0 causes all notes to be
		included.</para>
	     </listitem>
	     <listitem>
	        <para>Language: The preferred language of the user.  This
		language is used by the GUI and in email notifications.  Note
		that MantisBT uses UTF8 for encoding the data, and hence, the
		user can be interacting with MantisBT user interface in Chinese
		while logging issue data in German.</para>
	     </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>
	 </para>
    </section>

    <section id="admin.user.profiles">
        <title>User Profiles</title>

	<para>A user profile describes an environment that the user uses to run
	the software for which issues are being tracked.  The profile
	information include "Platform", "Operating System", "OS Version", and
	"Additional Description".  Each user has access to profiles that they
	create (can be multiple), in addition to global ones that are shared
	created by other users.  When reporting issues, users can elect to enter
	information like platform, operating system, version manually, or they
	can choose from the list of profiles that are already defined.</para>

	<para>Global profiles are typically used by the administrator to define
	a set of standard profiles that are typically used by the MantisBT
	users.  This makes it easier for the users to use such profiles without
	having to define create them.  The access level required for users to be
	able to create global profiles is configured by the $g_manage_global_profile_threshold
	configuration option and it is defaulted to MANAGER.</para>
