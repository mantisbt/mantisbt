        <title>Issue Creation</title>

	<para>The life cycle of an issue starts with its creation.  An issue can
	be created via one of the following channels:

	<itemizedlist>
	    <listitem><para>MantisBT Web Interface - This is where a user logs
	    into MantisBT and reports a new issue.</para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>SOAP API - Where an application automatically
	    reports an issue into MantisBT using the SOAP API web services
	    interfaces.  For example, the nighlty build script can automatically
	    report an issue if the build fails.</para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>Email - This is not supported out of the box, but
	    there are existing MantisBT patches that would listen to emails on
	    pre-configured email addresses and adds them to the MantisBT
	    database.</para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>Others - There can be several other ways to report
	    issues.  For example, applications / scripts that directly injects
	    issues into MantisBT database (not recommended, except for one-off
	    migration scripts), or PHP scripts that use the core MantisBT API
	    to create new issues.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	</para>

    <section id="admin.lifecycle.status">
        <title>Issue Statuses</title>

	<para>An important part of issue tracking is to classify issues as
	per their status.  Each team may decide to have a different set of
	categorization for the status of the issues, and hence, MantisBT
	provides the ability to customize the list of statuses.  MantisBT assumes
	that an issue can be in one of three stages: opened, resolved and
	closed.  Hence, the customized statuses list will be mapped to these
	three stages.  For example, MantisBT comes out of the box with the
	following statuses: new, feedback, acknowledged, confirmed, assigned,
	resolved and closed.  In this case "new" -> "assigned" map to opened,
	"resolved" means resolved and "closed" means closed.</para>

	<para>Following is the explanation of what the standard statuses that
	are shipped with MantisBT means.

	<itemizedlist>
	    <listitem><para>New - This is the landing status for new issues.  Issues
	    stay in this status until they are assigned, acknowledged, confirmed
	    or resolved.  The next status can be "acknowledged", "confirmed",
	    "assigned" or "resolved".</para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>Acknowledged - This status is used by the development team
	    to reflect their agreement to the suggested feature request.  Or to
	    agree with what the reporter is suggesting in an issue report, although
	    they didn't yet attempt to reproduce what the reporter is referring
	    to.  The next status is typically "assigned" or "confirmed".</para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>Confirmed - This status is typically used by the
	    development team to mention that they agree with what the reporter
	    is suggesting in the issue and that they have confirmed and
	    reproduced the issue.  The next status is typically
	    "assigned".</para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>Assigned - This status is used to reflect that the issue
	    has been assigned to one of the team members and that such team
	    member is actively working on the issue.  The next status is
	    typically "resolved".</para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>Resolved - This status is used to reflect that the issue
	    has been resolved.  An issue can be resolved with one of many
	    resolutions (customizable).  For example, an issue can be
	    resolved as "fixed", "duplicate", "won't fix", "no change required",
	    etc.  The next statuses are typically "closed" or in case of the
	    issue being re-opened, then it would be "feedback".</para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>Closed - This status reflects that the issue is completely
	    closed and no further actions are required on it.  It also typically
	    hides the issue from the View Issues page.  Some teams use "closed"
	    to reflect sign-off by the reporter and others use it to reflect the
	    fact that the fix has been released to customers.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

    <section id="admin.lifecycle.workflow">
        <title>Workflow</title>

	<para>Now that we have covered how an issue gets created, and what are
	the different statuses during the life cycle of such issues, the next
	step is to define the workflow.  In other words, how issues move from
	one status to another and who has access to trigger such transitions.
	MantisBT provides the ability for teams to define their own custom
	workflow which works on top of their custom status.  The workflow
	dictates the valid transitions between statuses and the user access
	level required of the user who triggers such transition.</para>

        <section id="admin.lifecycle.workflow.transitions">
	    <title>Workflow Transitions</title>

	    <para>This "Manage &gt; Manage Configuration &gt; Workflow
	    Transitions" page allows users with ADMINISTRATOR access level to do the
	    following tasks.

	    <itemizedlist>
	        <listitem><para>Define the valid next statuses for each status.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Define the default next status for each
		status.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Define the minimum access level required for a
		user to transition to each status.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Define the default status for newly created
		issues.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Define the status at which the issue is
		considered resolved.  Any issues with this status code greater
		than or equal to the specified status will be considered
		resolved.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Define the status which is assigned to issues
		that are re-opened.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Define the required access level to change the
		workflow.</para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
	    </para>

	    <para>Note that the scope of the applied change is
	    dependent on the selected project.  If "All Projects" is selected,
	    then the configuration is to be used as the default for all
	    projects, unless overidden by a specific project.  To configure for
	    a specific project, switch to the project via the combobox at the
	    top right corner of the screen.</para>
