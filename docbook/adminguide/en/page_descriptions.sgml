        <title>Main page</title>

        <para>This is the first page you see upon logging in. It shows you
            the latest news updates for the bugtracker. This is a simple news
            module (based off of work by Scott Roberts) and is to keep users
            abreast of changes in the bugtracker or project. Some news postings
            are specific to projects and others are global across the entire
            bugtracker. This is set at the time of posting in the Edit News
            section.The number of news posts is controlled by a global
            variable. When the number of posts is more than the limit, a link
            to show "older news" is displayed at the bottom. Similarly a "newer
            news" is displayed when you have clicked on "older news".There is
            an Archives option at the bottom of the page to view all
            listings.ArchivesA title/date/poster listing of ALL past news
            articles will be listed here. Clicking on the link will bring up
            the specified article. This listing will also only display items
            that are either global or specific to the selected project.

    <section id="admin.pages.filter">
        <title>View Issues page</title>

        <para>Here we can view the issue listings. The page has a set of
            viewing filters at the top and the issues are listed below.FiltersThe
            filters control the behavior of the issues list. The filters are saved
            between browsing sessions but do not currently save sort order or
            direction.If the number of issues exceeds the "Show" count in the
            filter a set of navigation to go to "First", "Last", "Previous",
            "Next" and specific page numbers are added.The Search field will
            look for simple keyword matches in the summary, description, steps
            to reproduce, additional information, issue id, or issue text id
            fields. It does not search through issue notes.

            Issue List - The issues are
            listed in a table and the attributes are listed in the following
            order: priority, id, number of issue notes, category, severity,
            status, last updated, and summary. Each (except for number of
            issue notes) can be clicked on to sort by that column. Clicking again
            will reverse the direction of the sort. The default is to sort by
            last modification time, where the last modified issue appears at the
            top. The issue id is a link that leads to a more detailed report about
            the issue. You can also add issue notes here. The number in the
            issue note count column will be bold if an issue note has been
            added in the specified time frame. The addition of an issue note
            will make the issue note link of the issue appear in the unvisited
            state. The text in the "Severity" column will be bold if the
            severity is major, crash, or block and the issue not resolved. The
            text in the "Updated" column will be bold if the issue has changed
            in the last "Changed(hrs)" field which is specified in the viewing
            filters. Each table row is color coded according to the issue
            status. The colors can be customised through MantisBT

        <para>Here is the simple listing of the issue report. Most of the
            fields are self-explanatory. "Assigned To" will contain the
            developer assigned to handle the issue. Priority is fully functional
            but currently does nothing of importance. Duplicate ID is used when
            an issue is a duplicate of another. It links to the duplicate issue
            which allows users to read up on the original issue report. Below the
            issue report is a set of buttons that a user can select to work on
            the issue.

                lists the custom fields defined in the system. There is also a
                place to enter a new field name to create a new field.The "Edit"
                links take you to a page where you can define the details of a
                custom field. These include it's name, type, value, and display
                information. On the edit page, the following information is defined

                All fields are compared in length to be greater than or equal to
                the minimum length, and less than or equal to the manimum length,
                unless these values are 0. If the values are 0, the check is
                skipped. All fields are also compared against the regular
                expression. If the value matches the expression, then the value is
                stored. For example, the expression "/^-?([0-9])*$/" can be used to
                constrain an integer.The table below describes the field types and
                the value constraints.

                <para>This page covers the status workflow. For most of these, the
                    fields are self explanatory and relate to a similarly named setting
                    in the configuration file. At the right of each row is a selector
                    that allows the administrator to lower the access level required to
                    change the particular parameter.The values changeable on this page

                    allowed from the status on the left edge to the status listed
                    across the top. This corresponds to the $g_enum_workflow array.At
                    the bottom, there is a list of access levels that are required to
                    change the status to the value listed across the top. This can be
                    used, for instance, to restrict those who can close an issue to a
                    specific level, say a manager. This corresponds to the
                    $g_set_status_threshold array and the $g_report_bug_threshold
                    setting.

        <title>Monitor Issue</title>

        <para>The monitor issues feature allows users to subscribe to
            certain issues and hence get copied on all notification emails that
            are sent for these issues.Depending on the configuration, sending a
            reminder to a user about an issue can add this issue to the user's
            list of monitored issues. Users who reported the issue or are assigned
            the issue typically don't need to monitor the issue to get the
            notifications. This is because by default they get notified on
            changes related to the issue anyway. However, administrators can
            change the configuration to disable notifications to reporters or
            handlers in specific scenarios.

        <para>Re-open issue button is visible in the issue view pages if the
            user has the appropriate access level and the issue is
            resolved/closed. Re-opening a issue will allow users to enter
            issue notes for the re-opening reason. The issue will automatically be

        <title>Delete Issue</title>


        <para>The delete issues button appears on the issue view pages for the
            users who have the appropriate access level. This allows you to
            delete an existing issue. This should only be used on frivolous or
            test issues. A confirmation screen will prompt you if you really want
            to delete the issue. Updaters, Developers, Managers, and
            Administrators can remove issues (you can also configure
            this).

        <title>Close Issue</title>

        <para>This is a button that appears on the issue view pages for
            users that are authorized to close issues. Depending on the
            configuration, users may be able to close issues without having to
            resolve them first, or may be able to only close resolved issues.
            After the button is clicked, the user is redirected to a page where
            an issue note maybe added.

        <title>Resolve Issue</title>


        <para>This option on the View Issues page allows you to resolve the
            issue. It will lead you to a page where you can set the resolution
            state and a duplicate id (if applicable). After choosing that the
            user can choose to enter an issue note detailing the reason for the
            closure. The issue is then set to the Resolved state. The reporter
            should check off on the issue by using the Close Issue button.

        <title>News Syndication</title>


        <para>MantisBT supports news syndication using RSS v2.0 protocol.
            MantisBT also supports authenticated news feeds for private projects
            or installations where anonymous access is not enabled. Authenticated feeds takes a
            user name and a key token that are used to authenticate the user
            and generate the feed results in the context of the user's access
            rights (i.e. the same as what the user would see if they were to
            logged into MantisBT).To get access to the News RSS as anonymous
            user, visit the following
            page:&nbsp;http://www.example.com/mantisbt/news_rss.php&nbsp;While a
            user is logged in, the RSS links provided in the UI will always
            provide links to the authenticated feeds, if no user is logged in
            (i.e. anonymous), then anonymous links will be provided.
