			<para>
				This event is triggered by the Mantis plugin system after all registered and enabled
				plugins have been initialized (their <code>init()</code> functions have been called).
				This event should <emphasis>always</emphasis> be the first event triggered for any
				page load.
			</para>

			<para>
				This event is the first point in page execution where all registered plugins are 
				guaranteed to be enabled (assuming dependencies and such are met).  At any point 
				before this event, any or all plugins may not yet be loaded.
			</para>

			<para>
				Suggested uses for the event include:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><para>Checking for plugins that aren't require for normal usage.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>Interacting with other plugins outside the context of pages or events.</para></listitem>
