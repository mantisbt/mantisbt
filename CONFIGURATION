This file contains information to help you customize Mantis.  A more
detailed doc is in the works.

* config_inc.php - this file contains all the site-wide variables.
  It is advisable to rename this to something else then change the
  require() statement in core_API.php to point to this new file.  This
  way you can easily upgrade your installations while not having
  to re-enter all your configuration settings.

  NOTE: since the package is still being changed a fair amount I suggest
  the following.  You configure the config_inc.php file but then rename
  it to something like my_config.php.  When you copy a new release
  over it will overwrite the config_inc.php.  Open up that file and
  at the very bottom put: include("my_config.php");
  This way any new varaibles get setup and then your custom settings
  overwrite anything else.  After you get up and running you can go back
  and modify config_inc.php and then repeat the cycle.

  The file contains several setting variables that you can configure.  Most of
  it should be self explanatory

* core_API.php - this file contains all the functions

* To add more categories just edit through the manage area.  The format must
  be separated by , and enclosed in ''.

  eg.  'bugtracker','other','display','core','loader'

* global variables are prefixed by g_
* parameters in functions are prefixed with p_
* form variables are prefixed with f_
* user related variables are prefixed with u_
* other variables are usually either prefixed with v_ or t_
* count variables have the word count in the variable name

* The files are split into three basic catgories, viewable pages,
include files and pure scripts. Examining the viewable pages (suffix _page)
should make the basic file format fairly easy to see.  The file names
themselves should make their purpose apparent.  I decided to break the
work into many small files rather than have a small number of really
large files.

* Most of the action scripts have a confirmation page to make sure the action
completed sucessfully.  The pages will automatically redirect you after a
short amount of time.  You can shorten of lengthen the time by editing
$g_wait_time in config_inc.php.

* Edit css_inc.php to make your own page formatting.

* You can edit the print_header() and print_footer() functions in core_API.php
  to alter what should be visible at the top and bottom of each page.

* All files were editted with TAB SPACES set to 4.  I'm sorry if this causes
a problem, but I can't stand 8 (wastes space) and tabs are helpful.  I've
tried to alleviate this in the config file by using spaces for the most part.

*** A note on globals: globals are a rather quirky item in php.  Basically
all variables are always local in scope unless declared global.  This is why
some of the include() files have global deslarations in them.
