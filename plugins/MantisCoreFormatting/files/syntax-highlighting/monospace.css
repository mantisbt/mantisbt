/*
 * Under "Config > User | Font Family" it is possible to select a font dedicated
 * for an user.
 *
 * The result is an inline style that applies this font to all elements.
 * Including the <span> elements which wraps the language tokens, within
 * the <code> element.
 *
 * <style>
 *  * { font-family: "Open Sans" }
 * </style>
 *
 * The font family for <code> elements are originally defined in the
 * bootstrap.css and is overwritten by the inline-style.

 *
 * This rule reapplies/forces the monospace font-family to them.
