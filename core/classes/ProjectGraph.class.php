/**
 * A class that builds a graph representation of all projects and subprojects, providing
 * simple tools to inspect and display the relations and inheritance between projects.
 *
 * The graph can be a complete graph for all existing projects, or can be limited to a
 * subset of projects (see constructor options). This subgraph can be based on user visibility,
 * enabled/disbaled projects, an access threshold, or an explicit set of project ids.
 * When restrictions are applied to the inclusion of projects, the graph is first built
 * with all projects and then reduced by removing those project nodes that don't meet the
 * contraints, while relinking the adjacent nodes to mantain the relative hierarchy.
 * For example: having projects: A, with B as child, and C as B's child, after removing B
 * C will become A's child.
 *
 * Graph nodes contain the relations to adjacent nodes in separate propertioes for node
 * parents, children, and inheritance (from parents). This relations can be used to
 * inspect a project children, parents or inheritance parents independently.
 *
 * The main tool to inspect the hierarchy is the traversal function, visiting the graph nodes
 * in any direction (parents, children, inheritance). The result is a tree traversal with
 * useful info about the order and depth of each visited node.
 * The traversal options offers a wide range of configuration to serve multiple purposes:
 * Inspect full hierarchy, immediate descendats, reachable nodes, inherited projects...

	 *     sort: null|integer|Callable  Whether to sort the related projects at each node. Can be either:
	 *                            - null, meaning no sorting will be made which is faster if not needed.
	 *                            - An integer, meaning use one of predefined sorting methods (see class

	 *                            (eg, for different users) that won't be reused, saving memory usage.
