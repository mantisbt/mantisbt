	 * type as the value.
	 *
	 * For example, to add an event "foo" to our Example plugin that does not expect a return value
	 * (an "execute" event type), and another event 'bar' that expects a single value that gets
	 * modified by each hooked function (a "chain" event type):
	 *

	 *       'EVENT_EXAMPLE_BAR' => EVENT_TYPE_CHAIN,
	 *   );
	 *  }
	 * }
	 * </code>
	 *
	 * When the Example plugin is loaded, the event system in MantisBT will add these two events to
	 * its list of events, and will then allow other plugins or functions to hook them. Naming the
	 * events "EVENT_PLUGINNAME_EVENTNAME" is not necessary, but is considered best practice to
	 * avoid conflicts between plugins.

	/**
	 * Hooking other events (or events from your own plugin) is almost identical to declaring them.
	 * Instead of passing an event type as the value, your plugin must pass the name of a class
	 * method on your plugin that will be called when the event is triggered. For our Example
	 * plugin, we'll create a foo() and bar() method on our plugin class, and hook them to the
	 * events we declared earlier.
	 *
	 * <code>
	 * class ExamplePlugin extends MantisPlugin {
	 * 		...
	 * 		function hooks() {
	 *   	return array(
	 *    	 	'EVENT_EXAMPLE_FOO' => 'foo',

	 *  	...
	 *   	return $p_chained_param;
	 * 	}
	 * }
	 * </code>
	 * Note that both hooked methods need to accept the $p_event parameter, as that contains the
	 * event name triggering the method (for cases where you may want a method hooked to multiple
	 * events).
	 * The bar() * method also accepts and returns the chained parameter in order to match the
	 * expectations of the "bar" event.
